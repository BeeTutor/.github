# Abstract
Imagine you’ve won a bid to have lunch with Warren Buffett—a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sit down with one of the world’s most successful investors and pick his brain. This idea isn’t just hypothetical; it’s inspired by the famous Warren Buffett Charity Lunch, where individuals bid millions of dollars for the chance to share a meal and gain invaluable insights from him.
BeeTutor embraces this dual role, aiming to build a bridge where people connect, exchange ideas, and learn from one another, no matter who they are or where they come from.

# What is BeeTutor ?
At BeeTutor, we take this concept and expand it on a much broader scale. We believe that the wisdom worth sharing isn’t limited to icons like Warren Buffett—everyone has valuable and unique experiences that can inspire others. Sometimes, we are the ones who inspire; at other times, we find ourselves inspired.

# Problem Statement
However, we have also discovered that there are several barriers preventing people from sharing effectively.

For sharers, monetizing their knowledge is often challenging. On traditional platforms like YouTube or Medium, they may need to meet stringent requirements, such as gaining over 1,000 subscribers, completing KYC verification, or even having a specific bank account (e.g., in the United States) just to earn ad revenue.

For seekers, finding and hiring suitable experts across borders can be equally difficult. Additionally, there is often a lack of proof of learning to validate their efforts and achievements.

To address these challenges, we have built an incentive-driven ecosystem designed to eliminate these barriers and create a more seamless sharing experience for everyone.
